## Introduction ‚ùáÔ∏è
This is a simple Rock Paper Scissor Game as a part of The Odin Project's Foundational Course curriculum. This game is based on traditional rules of the game. To help users, rule list is also provided in the web page.

## Features üéâ
This game currently has following features:
1. Play against computer: Use the buttons to make your choice and it will be compared with computer generated choice to see who wins.
2. Game Record: The choices made by both teams along with the winner result is shown
3. Score Tab: The score is recorded and updated live on each wins by either team.

## How It Works üìò
This project is very beginner friendly. It follows the workflow as stated below upon running the code:
- The page consists of rule section at the top. You can read it once to get the idea of game rules and then delete the section upon clicking on the button directly below the rules list.
- Then you will be left with the section that consists of images and buttons bellow the image. The button is the representation of the image shown.
- Upon clicking any button, your choice will be recorded and then computer choice will be generated.
- Based on the comparison between the two following the game rules, the result will be shown below on the "Game History" section.
- Along with the results, there is also score tab for recording scores. The winning team will have the score added by 1 each time they win.
- Upon getting a total of 5 wins by either player, the game will end with a simple alert message.
- If you wish to play again, for the time being, you will have to refresh the page.

## Technology Used üíª
For the completion of this project, following technologies were used:
-- HTML, CSS, Javascript, VS code, github

## Future Scope üçµ
Here are some potential features that can be added in this project:
- Multiplayer Option: Make it so that 2 players can compete against each other rather than the computer.
- Result History: Make sure the results do not update with each choices made but only upon the start of new game
- Choose Game Rounds: Users get to choose how many rounds they wish to play rather than a set of pre-determined rounds.
- Sounds and UI Animation: Add sound effects on clicking as well as animation highlighting the click. Also animate final result section upon winning the round.
